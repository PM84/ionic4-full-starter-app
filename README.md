## All in with Ionic 5 and Angular 8
This Ionic 5 Template includes lots of Ionic 5 components coded the angular way and features that you will love.

## 100% Flexible and Customizable
The template includes lots of pages, features and components but you are free to use just what you need and delete the code you don't. The code structure is super modularized so you will find easy to modify the code to fit your needs.

## CSS variables for the win
CSS Variables provide easy customization of an application and allow a value to be stored in one place, then referenced in multiple other places. So, for example if you want to change the colors of your app, by just changing some variables your app will have the desired colors in just a few seconds!

## Detailed documentation and Showcase
The template includes a super detailed documentation as well as an online showcase to help developers use the custom component the template offers.

## Ionic PWA
Ionic 5 is a step forward for Progressive Web Apps, that's why we are building this new ionic template with 100% support for PWA. Learn more about PWA with Angular and Ionic.

You will be able to use this Ionic 5 starter as an iOS app, an Android app, a web app or as a PWA! Too many options, right?

For a web app to be considered a PWA, it needs to comply with 10 principles. [Check how this Ionic Framework 4 app addresses each of them](https://ionicthemes.com/product/ionic4-full-starter-app-pro-version).

## Firebase Integration
Firebase is a popular tool that helps you build apps fast, without managing infrastructure and includes a powerful Database as a Service solution. We built a Firebase Integration for this Ionic Starter App that will show you how to build an advanced CRUD with Firestore as well as how to query your collections. It includes advanced examples with nested relations. *Note that this integration is optional, you can remove it if you don't want to use it.*


## Ionic Capacitor
[Capacitor](https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/native-cross-platform-web-apps-with-ionic-capacitor) is a cross-platform app runtime that makes it easy to build web apps that run natively on iOS, Android, Electron, and the web.

It provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web-standards as possible, while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them.

This Ionic 5 starter app is built using Capacitor and also shows how to use some of the APIs it provides.

## Other Integrations
Sometimes our apps need more features that why we added the most required ones to this PRO version.

Translating your ionic app into your desired language and creating a fully multilanguage app is now possible with this version of the template.

Videos are very important in current apps that's why we added a video playlist that you can use to play your own videos into an ionic app.

Also, we added a customizable Google Map and Geolocation using Capacitor Geolocation API.
